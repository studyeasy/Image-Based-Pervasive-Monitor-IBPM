The IBPM platform utilises Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically analyse X-ray images.
The platform will enable the automated analysis of X-ray images, providing a classification with an associated probability for the presence of COVID-19.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2). The rapid spread of COVID-19 and the resulting pandemic has seen a surge in demand for
laboratory testing globally resulting in shortages of reagents and equipment necessary to test for the
disease.
While the most promising diagnostic approaches developed so far continue to be refined to improve
efficiency and accuracy, such as nasopharyngeal and throat swabs followed by PCR and X-ray CT
interpretation.
This work proposes an online platform that utilises artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate the analysis
of X-ray and/or CT images for the detection of COVID-19. The platform will enable the differentiation
of patients suffering from COVID-19 from those who are not, the collation of empirical data for the
training of new more advanced models for image analysis and the provisioning of deployable models
